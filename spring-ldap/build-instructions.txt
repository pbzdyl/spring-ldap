In order to build the spring-ldap-person sample, you need to build spring-ldap first.

% cd spring-ldap
% ant dist

You will most likely get this error, if you haven't installed [url=https://javacc.dev.java.net/]JavaCC[/url] and pointed out to Ant where it is:

[code]
BUILD FAILED
... JavaCC home must be a valid directory.
[/code]

You install JavaCC say in /javacc-4.0 and put this in a spring-ldap/build.properties:

[code]
javacc.home.dir=/javacc-4.0
[/code]

Try building spring-ldap again:

% ant dist

If that succeeds, you'll get a snapshot build installed in your integration repo:

% ls ../integration-repo/artifacts/org.springframework/spring-ldap/
1.2.1-SNAPSHOT-20071206091603
ivy-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT-20071206091603.xml
ivy-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT-20071206091603.xml.md5
ivy-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT-20071206091603.xml.sha1

Next, you can build spring-ldap-person:

% cd ../spring-ldap-person
% ant

If that succeeds, you'll get a war in target/artifacts:

% ls target/artifacts/war
ldap-person.war

Deploy that in Tomcat and see how it goes.
