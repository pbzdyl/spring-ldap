Spring-LDAP 1.2 (Oct 2007)
-----------------------------
http://www.springframework.org/ldap

1. INTRODUCTION

Spring-LDAP is a library to simplify LDAP programming in Java, built on the same
principles as Spring Jdbc. 

The LdapTemplate class encapsulates all the plumbing work involved in traditional LDAP 
programming, such as creating, looping through NamingEnumerations, handling Exceptions
and cleaning up resources. This leaves the programmer to handle the important stuff - 
where to find data (DNs and Filters) and what do do with it (map to and from domain 
objects, bind, modify, unbind, etc.), in the same way that JdbcTemplate relieves the 
programmer of all but the actual SQL and how the data maps to the domain model.

In addition to this, Spring-LDAP provides Exception translation from NamingExceptions
to an unchecked exception hirearchy, as well as several utilities for working with filters,
LDAP paths and Attributes.

As of version 1.2, support for client-side compensating transaction is provided, as well as 
Java 5 generics support with the SimpleLdapTemplate.

2. RELEASE INFO

Spring LDAP requires J2SE 1.4 for running. 
J2SE 1.4, and javacc version 4.0 is required for building the Spring LDAP distributables from source code.
J2EE 1.4 (Servlet 2.3, JSP 1.2) is required for running the example.

The Spring-LDAP release comes in three different distributables:
* spring-ldap-bin-x.x.zip
  ** readme.txt - this readme file.
  ** license.txt - terms and conditions for use, reproduction and distribution
  ** dist/spring-ldap-x.x.jar - the library
  ** dist/spring-ldap-src-x.x.zip - the source code of the library
  ** dist/ivys - ivy configuration
  ** doc/api - api javadoc documentation
  ** doc/reference - full project reference documentation
  
* spring-ldap-bin-with-dependencies-x.x.zip
  ** readme.txt - this readme file.
  ** license.txt - terms and conditions for use, reproduction and distribution
  ** dist/spring-ldap-x.x.jar - the library
  ** dist/spring-ldap-src-x.x.zip - the source code of the library
  ** dist/ivys - ivy configuration
  ** lib - all referenced libraries necessary to use spring-LDAP
  ** doc/api - api javadoc documentation
  ** doc/reference - full project reference documentation
