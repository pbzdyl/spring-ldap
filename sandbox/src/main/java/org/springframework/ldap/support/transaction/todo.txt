RollbackOperations are stored before the actual operation has succeeded.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The recording of operations take place before the actual operation is carried out.
While this is needed (as we need the state as it was before the operation), this may cause
problems if the operation in question fails, causing a rollback to be performed.
The LdapCompensatingTransactionDataManager will then have a RollbackOperation to rollback
the failing operation. Example:
A rebind operation is recorded and the actual operation fails because the fromDn does not exist.
If toDn is already bound, the rollback will rename toDn to fromDn, messing things up.

We need to make sure that the RollbackOperation is not registered until the actual operation has
succeeded.

Invisible Attributes and rollback
---------------------------------
When recording an unbind operation the attributes of the unbound DN is retrieved. It is however
possible that some Attributes are not returned by that lookup, e.g. if they are operational
attributes (in which case they will need to be asked for explicitly.
This means that we might end up with inconsistent data after the rollback
(i.e. the Attributes after the rollback won't contain the invisible Attributes).
